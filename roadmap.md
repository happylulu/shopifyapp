Phase 0: Setup & Foundation (Current - 1 Week)
Objective: Ensure your development environment is fully configured, core app shell is running, and foundational technology choices are locked in.

Tasks:
Finalize Database Choice & Setup:
Confirm Neon or Supabase for your PostgreSQL hosting.
Create your database instance and get the connection string.
Project Initialization & Verification:
Ensure your Next.js Shopify app template is installed, configured with your Shopify app keys, and running locally, embedding correctly in your dev store.
Set up your basic FastAPI project structure. This will house your main business logic and database interactions for the loyalty program.
Environment Configuration:
Securely manage all necessary environment variables (DATABASE_URL for FastAPI/SQLAlchemy, Shopify API keys/secrets for Next.js, etc.) in .env files for both Next.js and FastAPI projects.
Version Control: Initialize Git repositories for both frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) if you haven't already, and commit initial setups.
Phase 1: Core Loyalty Data Model & Backend API (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy) (2-4 Weeks)
Objective: Define the database structure for your loyalty program and build the backend API endpoints to manage this data. This is the engine of your loyalty program.

Tasks:
Detailed Data Modeling (Conceptual & SQLAlchemy):
Based on your mockups, finalize the entities: CustomerLoyaltyProfile (Shopify Customer ID, points, tier_id, etc.), RewardDefinition (name, points_cost, type, conditions), TierDefinition (name, qualification_rules, perks), RedemptionLog.
Translate these into SQLAlchemy models (Python classes).
Define relationships between models (e.g., a customer has one loyalty profile, a profile has one tier).
Database Migrations (SQLAlchemy + Alembic):
Configure SQLAlchemy in your FastAPI project to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
Set up Alembic for managing database schema migrations.
Create your initial migration scripts based on your SQLAlchemy models and apply them to your database (this creates the actual tables).
Develop Core FastAPI CRUD Endpoints:
For CustomerLoyaltyProfile:
POST /loyalty/profiles/: Create a profile (e.g., when a customer makes their first relevant action or is synced).
GET /loyalty/profiles/{shopify_customer_id}/: Get a customer's loyalty profile (points, tier).
PUT /loyalty/profiles/{shopify_customer_id}/points/: Adjust points (internal use for now).
For RewardDefinition:
GET /rewards/: List available rewards.
(Admin-only for now) POST /rewards/: Create a new reward definition.
For TierDefinition:
GET /tiers/: List available tiers.
(Admin-only for now) POST /tiers/: Create a new tier definition.
Basic Business Logic Stubs:
Placeholder functions for point calculation, tier evaluation (won't be fully implemented yet).
API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI): FastAPI auto-generates this, ensure it's clean.
Initial Unit Tests: Write tests for your SQLAlchemy models and basic API endpoint functionality.
Phase 2: Frontend-Backend Initial Integration (Next.js <-> FastAPI) (2-3 Weeks)
Objective: Connect your Next.js frontend to the new FastAPI backend to display basic loyalty information and enable core interactions.

Tasks:
Identify Shopify Customer in Next.js:
Ensure you can reliably get the authenticated Shopify customer's ID from App Bridge in your Next.js client components.
Next.js Data Fetching Service/Hooks for FastAPI:
Create utility functions or custom hooks in Next.js to make authenticated Workspace requests (or use Tanstack Query/SWR) to your FastAPI loyalty endpoints.
Display Core Loyalty Info:
Based on your mockups, build/update Next.js components to:
Display the customer's current points (fetched from FastAPI).
Display the customer's current VIP tier (fetched from FastAPI).
List available rewards (fetched from FastAPI).
Basic Reward Redemption UI:
Implement a "Redeem Reward" button.
On click, call a FastAPI endpoint (e.g., POST /loyalty/redeem_reward/) sending shopify_customer_id and reward_id. The FastAPI endpoint will initially just log this or implement basic point deduction if ready.
Shopify Admin GraphQL API (via Next.js Proxy using Apollo Client):
Ensure Apollo Client is set up in Next.js to fetch any necessary data directly from Shopify (e.g., customer name, email to display alongside loyalty info) via your /api/graphql proxy as per the template.
Phase 3: Implementing Core Loyalty Logic & Shopify Webhooks (3-5 Weeks)
Objective: Flesh out the business rules for your loyalty program and automate key processes using Shopify webhooks.

Tasks (primarily in FastAPI):
Points Earning Logic:
Implement the rules: points per dollar, points for specific actions/products, etc.
Refine the PUT /loyalty/profiles/{shopify_customer_id}/points/ endpoint or create a dedicated service function.
VIP Tier Evaluation & Assignment Logic:
Based on points, spend, or other criteria, implement logic to automatically assign/update a customer's tier in their CustomerLoyaltyProfile.
(Optional but recommended) If a tier changes, consider making a Shopify API call (from FastAPI, or by signaling Next.js backend) to add/remove a customer tag (e.g., "VIP Gold") using the write_customers scope.
Full Reward Redemption Logic:
In FastAPI: verify points, deduct points, create a RedemptionLog entry.
If rewards involve Shopify actions (e.g., creating a discount code), FastAPI needs to securely call the Shopify Admin API. This might involve FastAPI using its own private app credentials or a system where Next.js (which handles Shopify OAuth) brokers these calls.
Shopify Webhook Handlers (in FastAPI, or Next.js proxying to FastAPI):
Develop secure FastAPI endpoints to receive Shopify webhooks (e.g., orders/paid, customers/update).
Implement robust webhook signature verification.
Process webhooks:
orders/paid: Trigger points earning logic and tier evaluation for the customer.
customers/update: Sync any relevant customer data if needed.
Testing: Write integration tests for these core logic flows.
Phase 4: Merchant Admin Interface & Enhancements (3-4 Weeks)
Objective: Allow merchants to configure and manage the loyalty program, and enhance the user experience.

Tasks:
Merchant Admin UI (Next.js):
Design and build pages within your embedded Next.js app for merchants to:
Configure tier rules (points/spend thresholds, perk descriptions).
Create and manage reward definitions.
View basic loyalty analytics (e.g., total points issued, rewards redeemed).
Admin API Endpoints (FastAPI):
Create secure FastAPI endpoints to support the merchant admin UI (CRUD for tiers, rewards, fetching analytics data).
Frontend Polish & Notifications:
Refine the customer-facing UI/UX.
Implement simple in-app notifications for points earned, tier upgrades, successful redemptions.
Error Handling & Edge Cases: Improve robustness across the board.
Phase 5: AI/LLM Feature Integration (4-6+ Weeks, can partially overlap or follow)
Objective: Develop and integrate the planned AI/LLM functionalities using FastAPI.

Tasks:
Finalize AI Use Cases & Data Needs: Clearly define what the AI will do (e.g., personalized reward recommendations, customer service Q&A about loyalty, analytics insights).
Vector Data Storage Strategy:
Decide: PostgreSQL with pgvector OR a dedicated vector database.
Set up and configure your chosen solution.
Unstructured Data Pipeline (FastAPI):
Ingest relevant data (e.g., product descriptions if rewards are product-based, past customer interactions if building a Q&A bot).
Implement text embedding generation.
Store embeddings and associated metadata.
Develop AI Endpoints (FastAPI):
Create FastAPI endpoints (e.g., /ai/recommendations, /ai/loyalty_chat).
Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): query vector store, construct prompts, call LLM APIs (OpenAI, etc.).
Integrate AI into Next.js Frontend:
Add UI elements for these AI features.
Call the FastAPI AI endpoints from your Next.js app.
Phase 6: Testing, Deployment, Monitoring & Shopify App Store Prep (Ongoing, intensified 2-4 Weeks before launch)
Objective: Ensure a high-quality, secure, and scalable application ready for production and the Shopify App Store.

Tasks:
Comprehensive Testing: End-to-end testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, security testing.
Deployment Pipeline:
Set up CI/CD for both Next.js (e.g., Vercel) and FastAPI (e.g., Render, Fly.io, Docker on a cloud provider).
Ensure your PostgreSQL database is configured for production.
Shopify App Review Preparation:
Thoroughly review all Shopify requirements (functionality, security, UI/UX, support).
Prepare listing materials, privacy policy, support documentation.
Monitoring & Logging: Implement robust logging in FastAPI and Next.js. Set up application performance monitoring (APM) and error tracking.
Backup & Recovery: Ensure your database backup strategy is in place.
General Principles Throughout All Phases:

Iterate: Build small, test, get feedback, then build more.
Version Control (Git): Commit frequently, use branches for features.
Security: Keep security in mind from the start (input validation, authentication, authorization, webhook verification).
Documentation: Document your API endpoints, data models, and complex logic.
User Experience: Continuously think about both the merchant and the end customer experience.
